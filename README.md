## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Challenges I Had Encountered:
 - Intially, I didn't start off with one item that was already in the wishlist app when it runs. So, when I tried to add more items to the list, the app would crash right away. 
   I learned that it was not possible to add items if the list is already empty to begin with. So, I solved this by starting the app with one item already in it.
 - Understanding how themes can be applied to the app's overall design
